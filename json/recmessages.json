My hope is that it will inspire and motivate you to do great things, no matter the cost. Back on track: Have you noticed the elephant statue right in front of you? No? Okay you just got exmatriculated. Just kidding! I want you to find out everything about this monument and the time it was built. Don’t hold back, it might become quite the adventure.
