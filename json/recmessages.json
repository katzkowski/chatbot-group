No? <br>Okay you just got exmatriculated. <br>Just kidding! I want you to find out everything about this monument and the time it was built. Don’t hold back, it might become quite the adventure. <br>Now, head over to the flea market near the Schlachte and look for an ancient artifact. You’ll know what I mean when you see it. <br>Use the GPS device that you just received to travel there. Good luck.<br>Oh and if there is any question, don't hesitate to send me a message with your new phone.",
