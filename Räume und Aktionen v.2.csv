0,"First Hallway","To your right there is a room with a slightly open door. To your left, you can go around a corner. There is also a locked door to a fire escape.","Use key"&"You Wait till no one watches and you put the rusty key in a lock of the fire exit. After some poking the door gives up and opens. You jump down the stairs. The door at the end opens far smoother than the first one, probably an older one and you're out. Only a few  minutes left to get to the GW1 where the exam takes place.
You have luck, you got a bus waiting for the right destination.
After the ride you are heading to the front of the GW1. Knowing you are on time makes you relieved and you are definitely going to pass the exam.

1,"Math Room","You walk towards the open door and already feel your math senses tickling.
You enter an empty room. There is a white board that is filled with weird math formulas, but something kicks in you and you sense a key hidden behind the wall of math. If you can solve this complex calculation you might be able to reach behind it...","Solve riddle"&"This is written on the white board:

You buy a watch for thirty euros.
You sell it for forty euros.
You buy it once again for fifty euros.
You sell it  once again for sixty euros.
How much euros did you gain compared to the very beginning?

There is an empty square on the bottom right which should be the place to write the answer.";"Leave room"&"Math makes you really sad. So you just walk out of the room quietly...";"20"&"You write the right answer on the board and in the corner of your eye you see a brick on the wall behind with crumbling mortar. You grab the brick and it gets loose. Behind the brick is a tiny Matryoshka doll. You open the matryoshka. Inside is an even tinier Matryoshka doll.  And inside this one is a rusty key with a keychain on it. Carved on the keychain are letters that appear random at first. You scratch the key against the wall to rub the rust off. You rub a bit too hard and shiny metal breaks out of the rust. Carvings on the metal spell the word “fire escape".

An idea forms into your head. If this key is really a key to the fire exit, it would not cause an alarm and you can swiftly exit the building. So u take your feet in your hands and get the hell out of the room.","hallway"?"First Hallway","There is a white board that is filled with weird math formulas, but something kicks in you and you sense a key hidden behind the wall of math.

"20" Kann erst nach solve riddle eingegeben werden. Mit "20" erhält man auch einen schlüssel
