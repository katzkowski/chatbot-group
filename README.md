## About 
Elephanture is an interactive, story-based adventure game that uses a chatbot as a human-computer interface. The game is based on a combination of a pre-written story and AI-generated text additions. 

Specifically, we trained a custom model for text generation using the OpenAI GPT-2. The model improves text descriptions within the game and is also used "as a voice" for certain NPC characters. As a result, the player gets different textual responses every time when playing the game, even if they are at the same stage of the game repeatedly. 

The chatbot's website is currently *not* available due to resource limits.
