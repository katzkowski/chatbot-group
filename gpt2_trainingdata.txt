You are now standing in front of the elephant monument in the Nelson Mandela Park. Your task is to find the hidden box to solve the riddle the professor gave you.
There is a bench, a trash bin and a strange looking bush near the monument. You also notice a small staircase leading below the base of the monument. The door looks old and rusty, with colonial time decorations and emblems engraved into it.
Great you got the bottle out! But now you really want to wash your hands.
The bench is covered by moss and bird shit. It hasn’t been used in some time. The paint has almost fallen off. This is not the place professor Kraysee would hide something.
The door is locked by some sort of mechanism. It won’t open. Trying to pry it open is probably not a good idea. It’s a monument after all. Let’s try not to incriminate ourselves just yet, shall we?
Look at this odd looking odd bush! Do you want to take a closer look? You want that right?
You are standing in front of the bush. All of a sudden there’s a mother with her child, the child says 'Mami mami there's a guy in the bush'.
It is a tiny piece of paper with random numbers on it. You should take it. Maybe they will be important in the future.
You pick up the piece of paper inside the box and read it.
To your right there is a room with a slightly open door. To your left, you can go around a corner. There is also a locked door to a fire escape.
There is a white board that is filled with weird math formulas, but something kicks in you and you sense a key hidden behind the wall of math.

Biology is the study of living things. It encompasses the cellular basis of living things, the energy metabolism that underlies the activities of life, and the genetic basis for inheritance in organisms. Biology also includes the study of evolutionary relationships among organisms and the diversity of life on Earth. It considers the biology of microorganisms, plants, and animals, for example, and it brings together the structural and functional relationships that underlie their day-to-day activities. Biology draws on the sciences of chemistry and physics for its foundations and applies the laws of these disciplines to living things.

Scavengers are animals that feed on dead and decaying animals for food. For eg., eagles, vultures. However, scavengers can also kill if the need arises.
Carnivorous animals such as lion and tiger have sharp teeth and powerful jaws to kill prey.
Carnivores or carnivorous animals rely on other animals for their food. These animals have several adaptations that help to hunt prey. For instance, most big cats such as lions and tigers have robust bodies, accompanied by powerful jaws capable of crushing bones.

Theropod dinosaurs from the Middle-Late Jurassic Yanliao Biota have been among the most significant discoveries informing the bird origins. However, with the exception of the bizarre scansoriopterygids, these species have shown some marked skeletal similarities to the slightly younger urvogel Archaeopteryx, for example, in skull shape and forelimb proportions.

Blood diamonds (also called conflict diamonds, brown diamonds, hot diamonds, or red diamonds) are diamonds mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency, an invading army's war efforts, or a warlord's activity. The term is used to highlight the negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas, or to label an individual diamond as having come from such an area. Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in Angola, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Guinea Bissau have been given the label. The term conflict resource refers to analogous situations involving other natural resource

The name "diamond" comes from the Greek word, "adamas" meaning unconquerable. Fittingly diamonds are made of pure carbon, and diamonds are the hardest natural substance known to man.[1] Diamonds have long been a sign of wealth and fortune. Kings and queens have worn these forms of concentrated carbon and even more countless millions people over time have lusted after them. These gems can be transparent, truculent white, yellow, green, blue, or brown. To understand the value of these stones, and ultimately their role in war, it helps to first understand their origins and where they come form. 
Diamonds are the most frequently used form capital by the rebels in Angola, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic Republic of Congo use to purchase weapons.  The earliest gem diamonds were found in India and Borneo, were they were found in riverbeds. In the early eighteenth century, deposits similar to those in India were found in Brazil. The story of diamonds in Africa began between December 1866 and February 1867, when a 15-year-old found a transparent stone on his father's farm, on the south bank of the Orange River. Within the next fifteen years, African diamond mines produced more diamonds than the India, the previous leading producer, had in the last 2,000 years. This increase in production occurred at the same time as the diamond mines in Brazil experiences a sharp decline in their production. The depletion of mines in Brazil assured that supply would remain stable and diamond prices would not fall as they previously had when Brazil over produced in the 1730s.[2]
Diamonds are the pure form of carbon in a transparent state, that is formed below the surface of the Earth. Over 150 Kilometers below the Earth’s surface in the mantle, diamonds are formed. The diamonds make their way up the surface captured within liquid hot rock or magma. Once they reach the surface diamonds can be found in volcanic pipes called kimberlite pipes or in loose mineral deposits called alluvial deposits.
Alluvial deposits are created by diamond pipe erosion and are easily excavated. They require very little financial capital to be invested in the removal. This is due to the fact that they are often found in riverbeds and along the coast and they do not require highly advanced mining techniques nor due they require a large amount of human capital. The simplest method of mining alluvial deposits is with a shovel and a pan. With this method diamonds and soil are shoveled into a hand held pan where they are separated by agitation and shorted by eye. More advanced methods of mining use large machinery that moves the alluvial in to large shorting pans that send different densities to smaller picking tables followed by a grease table. Since diamonds are mostly water repellent, they are sorted in alluvial deposits by using grease. While other minerals develop a water coding and slide of the grease, the water resistant diamonds stick to the grease and are collected.
Mining kimberllite pipe requires a more advanced degree of mining technology and is more expensive. The first step in mining a kimberlite pipe is to dig the pit. In "open-pit" or "open-cast" mining, the layers of rock are dug up and eventually tunnels and pipe are build so the hard ore material can be removed with large hydraulic shovels and trucks. The hard rock is broken into pieces with shovels and other methods until the rock is small enough to be remove from the mine by truck. When the kimberlite ore is deep underground it must be removed by mining a series of underground shafts in the pipe that allow the ore to be carved off and make its way down the tunnel to a draw point. At these points the crushed ore is brought up to the surface for processing. Only about 20% of the world's diamonds are taken from pipe mines, and the remaining 80% of diamonds are alluvial.
In 1866, the first diamonds in Africa were found. Before the discovery of diamonds in South Africa diamonds were very scarce and they were highly valued. Following the discovery of diamonds in Africa the production of diamonds increased tenfold in the next tens years.

Today, over two thirds of the world’s diamonds come from one company, De Beers. The London based company was one the first companies involved in the mining for diamonds in Africa immediately following their discovery. Cecil Rhodes was attracted to the new prospects of mining in African and he started his search for diamonds in 1870. Another English immigrant miner named Barney Barnato, Rhodes’ rival, also fought to control the same diamond claims as Rhodes. By 1880, Rhodes had bought out Barnato and had founded De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. Rhodes envisioned controlling the whole diamond market. By 1888, he had realized his vision and he had gained monopolistic control over the whole diamond market.  He completed his monopoly with the formation of cartel, the London Diamond Syndicate, who were that biggest diamond merchants of the time. His syndicate allowed him to perfectly match supply with demand. They provided him with critical information about the diamond market allowing him to create an artificially controlled supply of diamonds. In return for their assistance, the diamond merchants were guaranteed a certain amount of diamonds from Rhode’s mines.
In 1929, Sir Ernest Oppenheimer was elected as the chairman of the board of De Beers. Oppenheimer followed the model of his predecessor by using the single channel marketing structure and formed the Central Selling Organization (CSO) by incorporating other major sellers and producers into De Beers syndicate. Oppenheimer’s strategy was tested during the Great Depression and the amount of diamonds mined were significant higher than the amount of buyers at that time. As a result, Oppenheimer was forced to close many of De Beers mines and still purchase diamonds form other members of the CSO as arranged.
Following the death of Sir Ernest Oppenheimer in 1957, his son Harry assumed the role of chairman at De Beers. Like his father he believed strongly in single channel marketing and in 1958 he signed an agreement with the Soviet Union to purchase their diamonds that were being mined at the Mir mine in Yakutia. Before Harry’s role as chairman, he made some very significant contributions to De Beers. In 1939, Harry initiated the marketing campaign for diamonds in the United States. This campaign helped to expand the market for diamonds to middle class Americans who had previously believed that diamonds were only for the extremely wealthy. As a result of their marketing scheme, De Beers was able to increase the supply diamonds in the world to meet the new demand. In 1947, the famous slogan “A diamond is forever” was penned and the De Beers marketing machine was born. By 1982, De Beers was marketing diamonds all over the world including Europe, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan. At this point, it had become critical for De Beers to be able to expand demand as a result of all the new mines that were being discovered and exploited.

Despite their marketing success to increase demand for diamonds, De Beers was forced to stockpile a large number of their own diamonds between 1992 and 1998. De Beers stockpile grew by over one million dollars as a result of the increase of rough diamonds. By the end of the twentieth century, De Beers marketing strategy had begun to back fire on them. Their supply management have led to legal troubles in the Uniteed States. The Department of Justice have charge De Beers with violating U.S. antitrust laws and as a result they now have a reduced presence in the United States. The costs of creating a diamond buffer and advertise for the whole market had become unsustainable for them. As a result, the twenty first century saw them to begin to restructure their company and rethink their marketing strategy. But, despite this slight hiccup in De Beers continual monopolist presence in the diamond market, they still control over two thirds of today’s market ant they are still the driving force behind the Diamond markt.

Near the centre of the northern German city of Bremen is a large elephant made of bricks. This imposing ten-metre high structure — designed by Fritz Behn — was completed in 1931 as a monument to the German colonies which then included Cameroon, Togo, Deutsch-Ostafrika [Tanzania], Deutsch-Südwestafrika [Namibia] and several islands. For decades the “Reichskolonialehrendenkmal” stood as a powerful symbol of German colonial ambition that spanned both the Nazi era and the post-war period of reconstruction: an aesthetic continuity that stands in sharp contrast to the hurried erasure of the DDR.

<|endoftext|>

In 1988, however, a metal sign was created next to the elephant by the youth wing of the Bremen metal workers union in support of the Anti-Apartheid movement. In 1990, with the celebration of Namibian independence from South Africa, the elephant itself was re-dedicated as the “Bremen anti colonial monument” thereby attempting to invert its historical meaning yet retaining the original design. And in 2009 a new monument was created next to the elephant to the victims of German genocide: between 1904 and 1908 over 70,00 of the Ovaherero, Nama and Damara peoples of Namibia were murdered followed by an intensified phase of racial segregation that pre-figured the development of Apartheid in South Africa. In contrast to the elephant the genocide memorial adopts a more abstract design reminiscent of land art or street installations: a horizontal array of simple elements such as rocks and stones in the place of vertical bombast.
This assemblage of memorials and plaques reveals that the German colonial presence in Africa was not a minor element in European history: we now know that many of the perpetrators of early twentieth-century violence in Namibia and elsewhere would go on to play a significant role in Nazi expansionism in Europe. In the place of the Herero were the Slavs and others to the east, where an envisioned settler landscape bore parallels with European sequestration of fertile lands in Africa. What is especially interesting about Bremen’s elephant is that it poses the possibility for changing the meaning of public monuments: it allows remnants of the past to become incorporated into new understandings of history. How many other elephants remain unnoticed or unchallenged in European towns and cities?
Is there a secret passage under the elephant? The most common rumor she has to clear is that an underground passage leads from the crypt to the city center. This gave the impression that you could go underground from there through the city. However, the stories about African blood diamonds are not entirely out of thin air. Because the elephant was supposed to praise German colonialism - despite the violence against the African population. The "Cenotaph" should actually be in Berlin. A colonial war memorial was planned there in 1908. The design by the artist Fritz Behn, an African elephant, failed. The elephant was completed in 1931. But even the ceremonial inauguration of the memorial was a fiasco. Because at the beginning of the 1930s there were clashes and street fights between Nazis and their political opponents almost every day. This led to a ban on all political gatherings in the open air - and thus the planned inauguration ceremony. After the Second World War, however, the colonial idea was no longer considered important.

A few years latera position opened at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, I jumped sight unseen. South Africa had recently held its first democratic election. It was going through a process of democratizing society,andit had a lively civil society movement and a militant trade union movement. I convinced the colleagues at Wits that I was theirperson to teach continental philosophy and ethics. Teaching at Wits was remarkably challenging and meaningful. The university hada massive influx of 
Black students from poorly equipped township schools. They were joined in the classroom bywhite students many of whom were from elite public and private schools. Figuring out how to manage the hugedifferences in educational backgrounds and to serve the needs of the Black students was an enormous, but exciting, challenge. In South Africa I deepened my interest in global justice and wrote my first book, Cosmopolitan Justice. That book was published a full 12 years after Idefended my dissertation. The time spent working in teaching heavy positions and being active in political movements had slowed my writing output considerably.
After nearly 7 years of livingin South Africa,my wife and I reluctantly decided to move backto the USAwhere it was safer to raise our son who had been born in South Africa. I took a position as the founding Director of the Institute for Ethics and Public Affairs at San Diego State University. That position allowed me organize workshops, conferences, and lecture series on themesof contemporary moral and political philosophical importance. Ihad come from the margins of academic Philosophy; and it was through organizing those events at SDSU that I first met many of the leading moral and politicalphilosophers.
I am Professor for International Political Theoryat Goethe Universität Frankfurt. My primary academic appointment is in Political Science, but I also have a secondary appointment in Biology. I have followed acircuitous professional path. It might interest grad students and post docs to know that one does not have to start out with a plum job at a research institution to have a meaningful and enjoyable career. My PhD is in Biology from the Claremont Graduate School, a place not known for high prestige placements.

Everyone loves the first day of school, right? New year, new classes, new friends. It's a day full of potential and hope, before all the dreary depressions of reality show up to ruin all the fun.I like the first day of school for a different reason, though. You see, I have a sort of power. When I look at people, I can...sense a sort of aura around them. A colored outline based on how long that person has to live. Most everyone I meet around my age is surrounded by a solid green hue, which means they have plenty of time left.A fair amount of them have a yellow-orangish tinge to their auras, which tends to mean a car crash or some other tragedy. Anything that takes people "before their time" as they say.The real fun is when the auras venture into the red end of the spectrum, though. Every now and again I'll see someone who's basically a walking stoplight. Those are the ones who get murdered or kill themselves. It's such a rush to see them and know their time is numbered.With that in mind, I always get to class very early so I can scout out my classmates' fates. The first kid who walked in was basically radiating red. I chuckled to myself. Too damn bad, bro. But as people kept walking in, they all had the same intense glow. I finally caught a glimpse of my rose-tinted reflection in the window, but I was too stunned to move. Our professor stepped in and locked the door, his aura a sickening shade of green.

When my sister Betsy and I were kids, our family lived for awhile in a charming old farmhouse. We loved exploring its dusty corners and climbing the apple tree in the backyard. But our favorite thing was the ghost.We called her Mother, because she seemed so kind and nurturing. Some mornings Betsy and I would wake up, and on each of our nightstands, we'd find a cup that hadn't been there the night before. Mother had left them there, worried that we'd get thirsty during the night. She just wanted to take care of us.Among the house's original furnishings was an antique wooden chair, which we kept against the back wall of the living room. Whenever we were preoccupied, watching TV or playing a game, Mother would inch that chair forward, across the room, toward us. Sometimes she'd manage to move it all the way to the center of the room. We always felt sad putting it back against the wall. Mother just wanted to be near us.Years later, long after we'd moved out, I found an old newspaper article about the farmhouse's original occupant, a widow. She'd murdered her two children by giving them each a cup of poisoned milk before bed. Then she'd hanged herself.The article included a photo of the farmhouse's living room, with a woman's body hanging from a beam. Beneath her, knocked over, was that old wooden chair, placed exactly in the center of the room.

Carter had murdered a 17 year old girl, just so her corpse could stare at him.The story gave me shivers, and after I went home, I felt like there were hundreds of pairs of eyes just watching me no matter how I turned.Today, however, was the first day that I acted out. I was cooking breakfast, when I felt the eyes. Instinctively, out of fear, I threw my kitchen knife, which lodged itself into the wall. As I pulled it out, I found myself staring at a pair of eyes, pickling in formaldehyde.I've been watching the police peel away the drywall of my house for hours now. So far, they've found 142 pairs of eyes in little glass jars. The scariest thing is, each and every one was staring at me.
