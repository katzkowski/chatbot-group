        You go down an alley and see a strange woman. <br> She checks her watch nervously multiple times and looks around, as if she doesn't want to be seen. She is standing betwen multiple big Flowerpots, but they are all empty.
      </li>
      
      <li class="chat-message-user">
        I'll hide behind a big pot and observe.
      </li>

      <li class="chat-message-bot">
        A tall man approraches her and the woman quickly jumps into one of the pots aswell, her head sticking out like a turnip. The man walks up to her and stops. "Come out little turnip" he says. The woman steps out and bows down before him. She hands him a white paper bag, which he almost rips out of her hand, and opens. smiles and nods at her, then they both walk away into two different directions. 
      </li>

      <li class="chat-message-user">
        Step out of the flower pot.
      </li>
      
      <li class="chat-message-bot">
        As you step out of the pot, you hear a strange sound from behind you. You see another guy stepping out of a pot, holding a camera and a pack of tissues, the chubby man tries hide his face behind his cap as he notices you. He escapes into a side alley.
      </li>
